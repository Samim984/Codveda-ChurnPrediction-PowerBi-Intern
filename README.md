📉 Codveda – Task 4 | Power BI Internship Project
Customer Churn Intelligence & Retention Strategy

From Churn Detection to Actionable Retention Decisions

📊 Power BI · Business Analytics · Churn Analysis · Decision Intelligence

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer churn analysis using behavioral, cost, and service interaction data to help businesses understand why customers leave and where retention efforts should be focused.

Built during my Power BI Internship at Codveda, the dashboard transforms raw customer-level data into a decision-oriented churn intelligence system.
Instead of reporting churn as a single metric, the project emphasizes risk segmentation, action prioritization, and forward-looking churn exposure.

The analysis demonstrates how churn is influenced more by tenure, cost pressure, and service friction than by customer volume alone.
